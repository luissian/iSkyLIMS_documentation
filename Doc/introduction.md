The first version of iSkyLIMS had been deployed in December 2017. Since then, more than 4000 samples sequenced on 170 flow cells have been re-runed and processed, to have historic information from the last years.
The use of SpaceLIMS led to a drastic reduction on time and human errors that takes to carry out primary and secondary data analyses.
Primary data analysis refers to de-multiplexing and conversion of BCL to FASTQ format.
SpaceLIMS automatically generates and launches the scripts needed for primary data analysis. Depending on read length and read mode (single read or paired end read), primary data analysis is generally finished within a few hours after the last chemistry cycle.
