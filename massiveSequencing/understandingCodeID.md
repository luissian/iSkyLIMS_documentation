# Understanding Code ID


While reading this user guide, we have advice you to visit this chapter for having more details about how the sample is coding through the different steps.

## Sample_CodeID

Each time that a sample is recorded is assigned to a unique code.
The sample_codeID is created by joining the userID in iSkyLIMS and the sample name that user type when creating the sample.
The format is:

> <userID>_<sample_name>

The for example the sample codeID “admin_Next-001”, means that the user who registered the sample was the userid “admin” and the sample name was “Next-001”

We say that it is unique because sample name MUST be unique. Remember that this was one of the requirements that described at the Introduction chapter.
