# Massive Sequencing Configuration

To provide the flexibility, that we want to give to the "Massive Sequencing" module, is necessary to define fields, and many others parameters in order that you can have right parameters that you need to use.

For adding this information we have created quite many forms that help you to define the showed information that is needed to fill when recording sample data.

We have divided the configuration based on the kind of information to define and which type of user has the best knowledge to do it.

Having this on mind we have split the configuration in 3 type of users:

*   **Admin**. which will be in charge of network configuration information
*   **Wetlab Manager** to fill all  information related to the samples
*   **Investigator** for adding the kit lot numbers used during the sample preparations
